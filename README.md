Scaruby is not a thin layer of `java.io` but a thick layer of it.  Users of Scaruby don't need to 
know the detail of `java.io`.  Instead, Scaruby provides the way to do file I/O independently.

## Features

* Builtin loan pattern
* Simple operation can be done by simple method call
* Base64 encode/decode 
* Every SReader/Swriter can be used in `for-expression`, which is implemented as `foreach` method.
* Support reading text/binary content from SURL
* No overloading! Instead, use type classes or default arguments
* Additional features will be added as needed

## Usage

Now Scaruby supports Scala 2.11.X and Scala 2.12.X.

Add the following lines to your build.sbt:

```scala
resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"

libraryDependency += "com.github.scaruby" %% "scaruby" % "0.2"
```

and you can use Scaruby like the following after importing the package `com.github.scaruby._`:

```scala
import com.github.scaruby._

val content = SFile.read("file.txt")
```

```scala
import com.github.scaruby._

val input = "Hello, World!"
val encoded = SBase64.encode64(input.getBytes("UTF-8"))
val decoded = new String(SBase64.decode64(encoded), "UTF-8")
assert(input == decoded)
```

```scala
import com.github.scaruby._
val content = for { 
  r <- SURL("https://srad.jp/").openReader
} r.readAll
println(content)
```
